# Enhancing Software Security: Leveraging Machine Learning and Data Modeling Techniques for Vulnerability Analysis
## Project Scope
### WHAT IS THE MAIN GOAL FOR THIS PROJECT?
We are seeking collaboration with students to utilize cutting-edge AI, machine learning, and data modeling techniques in enhancing our existing prototype. The project aims to identify true and false positive cyber security vulnerabilities and accurately assess risk by analyzing Static Code Analysis Tool results.

We are inviting students to participate in a project that encompasses the following tasks:
Conduct thorough background research on our current product and the datasets it uses.
Investigate and explore the most recent advancements in AI, machine learning, and data modeling, focusing on their potential applications to our dataset.
Develop an AI/ML model and implement data modeling techniques that aim to reduce human involvement significantly in determining the accuracy of vulnerability scanning results, distinguishing between true and false positives.

### WHAT TASKS WILL LEARNERS NEED TO COMPLETE TO ACHIEVE THE PROJECT GOAL?
At the project's conclusion, students are expected to present a comprehensive final report, inclusive of all source materials like code and workbooks, showcasing:
In-depth comprehension of the datasets available.
A clear understanding of the problem being addressed.
Detailed methodologies and approaches employed in the project.
Thoroughly documented outcomes and achieved results.
Recommendations for the next steps our organization should take.
Moreover, students are required to provide the source code of their solution. As an additional benefit, multiple versions of potential solutions can be included in the process.

### COMPENSATION OFFERED
Academic experience

### HOW WILL YOU SUPPORT LEARNERS IN COMPLETING THE PROJECT?
Students will connect directly with us for mentorship throughout the project. We will be able to provide answers to questions such as:
Current product understanding
Current data sets and guidance in navigating them
Input on choices, problems or anything else the students might encounter

### WHAT SKILLS OR TECHNOLOGIES WILL HELP LEARNERS TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT?
To undertake this project, students have the option to self-teach, but prior familiarity with any of the following areas would be advantageous:
Modern ML techniques
Data Modeling techniques
Software development
Python's ML ecosystem
However, it's important to note that prior knowledge in these areas is not mandatory. Students will be encouraged to research and acquire knowledge in these domains as the project progresses.

## ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION
https://ml4cyber.com/

Our information society is driven by software created by organizations in the private and public sector. These software applications are rarely perfect. They often contain cyber security vulnerabilities (software “bugs”) which when exploited by malicious attackers can lead to dangerous intrusions of computer systems. We have developed a high-reliability, automated approach to analyzing software code for vulnerabilities that is a leap forward in technology when compared to competing commercial solutions. We propose an efficient Machine Learning approach to identify both true positives and false positives with very high accuracy: greater than 90%. This valuable solution reduces the time required to find vulnerabilities by a factor of ten (10) or more, and the results are highly reliable.
